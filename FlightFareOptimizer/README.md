## FlightFareOptimizer
In the highly competitive travel industry, pricing strategies can significantly impact a company's revenue and market share. FlightFareOptimizer is a machine learning project designed to predict flight fares on various routes, empowering 'EaseMyTrip' (or any travel startup) to make informed pricing decisions and enhance customer engagement

## Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Shutil, Sklearn(scikit learn)

Tools: Jupyter Notebook, GitHub

Data Sources: Historical flight data of 'EaseMyTrip' from Kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhambathwal/flight-price-prediction.)

## Future Enhancements:
Incorporate Real-Time Data: Enhance the model by integrating real-time data sources for more accurate predictions.
Advanced Customer Segmentation: Develop more sophisticated algorithms for customer segmentation to offer highly targeted promotions.
Global Expansion: Adapt the model for predicting fares on international routes and in different markets.

FlightFareOptimizer aims to revolutionize how 'Eaze My Trip' (like startups) approaches flight pricing, customer retention, and revenue optimization through the power of machine learning and data-driven insights.
